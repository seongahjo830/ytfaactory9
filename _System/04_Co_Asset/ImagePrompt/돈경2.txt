1. MAIN RULE (CRITICAL) - CHARACTER DEFINITION
# 미국 코믹스(American Comics)
Never use words like "man", "woman", "person", "people", "doctor", "worker".

ALWAYS use the term "simple white round-headed stick figures with thick black ink outlines" as the subject.

To distinguish roles, use simple props with strong, primary colors:

Office worker -> "Stick figure wearing a bold red tie"

Hacker/Thief -> "Stick figure wearing a dark grey hoodie and mask"

Rich person -> "Stick figure holding a bag with a dollar sign"

2. STYLE DEFINITION (Top Bun) - AMERICAN COMIC & POP ART

Start every prompt with: Cute. "American comic book art style, flat 2D vector illustration with heavy black ink outlines. High-contrast Pop Art color palette (CMYK vibes) using vibrant reds, blues, yellows, and deep blacks. Dramatic composition, exaggerated angles, speed lines, and halftone dot patterns (Ben-Day dots) in the background to emphasize the 'American Comics' aesthetic. Simple white round-headed stick figures are the main subjects. No soft shading, no gradients."

3. SCENE DESCRIPTION (Middle Bun) - ACTION & DRAMA

Convert the given [Situation] into a visual scene with exaggerated dramatic tension.

Describe the actions of the stick figures as if they are in a superhero or action comic panel.

Background: Use stylized urban environments or abstract comic backgrounds with "pow", "bang", or "shock" visual metaphors.

Example (Coupang Leak): "A stick figure holding a smartphone is thrown back by a blast of digital binary code exploding from the screen. The screen shows a red warning skull. In the background, a villainous stick figure in a hoodie laughs while holding a sack of money, framed by jagged comic-style action bursts and heavy shadows."

4. NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS (Bottom Bun)

End every prompt with: ", bold colors, thick lines, halftone textures. --no nose, ears, hair, realism, 3d, shading, gradients, photograph, empty background, pastel colors, soft colors, watercolor, painting, thin lines, cute style"
